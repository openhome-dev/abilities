### Basic Flow

**1. Activate the ability**
```
You: "Daily digest"
Assistant: "Here's your Reddit technology digest."
```

**2. Listen to the 3-story summary**
```
Assistant: "First, developers are discussing the new Python release with 
major performance improvements. Second, there's debate about AI coding 
assistants replacing junior developers. Third, a viral post about 
quantum computing breakthroughs at MIT. Want more about one, two, or three?"
```

**3. Expand any story that interests you**
```
You: "Tell me about number two"
Assistant: "The Reddit thread explores how AI tools like GitHub Copilot are 
changing coding workflows. Many developers argue they enhance rather than 
replace human programmers. Want another one, or are you done?"
```

Assistant: [Explains quantum computing story]
Assistant: "Want another one, or are you done?"

You: "Done"
