# Smart Sous Chef 🍳

Smart Sous Chef is a voice-first cooking assistant built for the OpenHome platform.  
It uses the Spoonacular API to fetch real recipes and guides users step-by-step through cooking — completely hands-free.

## 🎯 What It Does

Smart Sous Chef allows users to:

- Search for real recipes by name
- Follow step-by-step cooking instructions
- Say “next” or “repeat” to control flow
- Ask ingredient questions like “How much garlic?”
- Set multiple named kitchen timers
- Ask for nutrition information
- Exit anytime with “stop” or “exit”

Designed specifically for voice speaker environments.

## 🏗 How It Works

Smart Sous Chef:

1. Accepts a recipe name from the user
2. Calls the Spoonacular API
3. Retrieves structured recipe data
4. Enters guided cooking mode
5. Reads one instruction at a time
6. Waits for user navigation commands

It uses:

- OpenHome SDK (`MatchingCapability`)
- Asynchronous session tasks for timers
- `urllib` for API calls (sandbox-safe)
- Voice-optimized short responses

## 🧠 Design Principles
