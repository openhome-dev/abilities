# Publishing to the Marketplace

Once your Ability is working, you can publish it to the OpenHome Marketplace so anyone can install it.

## Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** — Make sure your Ability works in the Live Editor with different inputs, including edge cases and exit commands.

2. **Go to Abilities** on [app.openhome.com](https://app.openhome.com)

3. **Select your Ability** and click the publish/share option

4. **Fill in Marketplace info:**
   - **Name:** Clear, descriptive name
   - **Description:** What it does in 1-2 sentences
   - **Image:** Upload a representative image
   - **Key Features:** Tag the main capabilities

5. **Publish** — Your Ability will appear in the Marketplace for others to install.

## Tips for a Good Listing

- **Name clearly** — "Weather Checker" is better than "My Ability v2"
- **Describe the experience** — "Ask for any city and get current temperature and wind speed" beats "Gets weather data"
- **Note API requirements** — If users need their own API key, say so upfront
- **Test the first impression** — The trigger words and greeting are the first thing users experience. Make them natural.

## Linking to GitHub

If your Ability is also in this repo, add a link in your Marketplace description:

> View source code and contribute: [GitHub →](https://github.com/openhome-dev/abilities)

This builds trust and invites improvements.
